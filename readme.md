This is a cartogram. It is an alternative method of displaying a map.

## Why not use a map?
A couple of reasons:

- The sizes of each state are drastically different when compared to
each other. This results in a map where areas such as the Wilayah
Persekutuan, become too tiny relative to other states.

- Other states however (looking at you Sarawak), have parliamentary
seats that are drastically different in sizes, causing the
mismatch relative to other seats.
